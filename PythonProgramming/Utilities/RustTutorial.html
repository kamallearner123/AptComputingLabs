        <h2>What is Rust?</h2>
        <p>Rust is a modern systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. Developed by Mozilla, it eliminates many of the common pitfalls of other low-level languages like C and C++ by providing memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory Safety:</strong> Rust ensures memory safety through its ownership and borrowing system, preventing data races and null pointer dereferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Rust achieves performance on par with C and C++, with fine control over memory usage and system resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Rust simplifies writing safe concurrent code, avoiding common concurrency issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Learn Rust?</h2>
        <p>Rust is increasingly becoming the go-to language for performance-critical applications such as game engines, web assembly, embedded systems, and large-scale systems programming.</p>
        
        <p>Key benefits of Rust include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strong focus on safety and security.</li>
            <li>High performance with minimal runtime overhead.</li>
            <li>Great for concurrency and parallelism.</li>
            <li>Growing community with excellent tooling and documentation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Basic Syntax and Example Programs</h2>

        <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
        <p>The simplest program in Rust is the "Hello, World!" program, demonstrating basic syntax and how to print text to the console.</p>

        <pre><code>// hello.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
</code></pre>
        <p>In this program:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>fn main()</code> is the main function where the execution starts.</li>
            <li><code>println!</code> is a macro to print text to the console.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Variables and Mutability</h3>
        <p>Rust variables are immutable by default. To make a variable mutable, use the <code>mut</code> keyword.</p>

        <pre><code>// variables.rs
fn main() {
    let x = 5; // Immutable variable
    println!("x = {}", x);

    let mut y = 10; // Mutable variable
    println!("y = {}", y);
    
    y = 15;
    println!("y is now = {}", y);
}
</code></pre>

        <h3>Data Types and Functions</h3>
        <p>Rust has strong static typing. Here's an example of declaring variables with different data types and calling functions.</p>

        <pre><code>// data_types.rs
fn main() {
    let a: i32 = 10; // Integer type
    let b: f64 = 20.5; // Floating point type
    let is_active: bool = true; // Boolean type
    let name: &str = "Rust"; // String type

    println!("Integer: {}, Float: {}, Boolean: {}, Name: {}", a, b, is_active, name);

    let result = add(5, 10);
    println!("5 + 10 = {}", result);
}

// A simple function that adds two integers
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
</code></pre>

        <h3>Control Flow</h3>
        <p>Rust provides control flow constructs such as <code>if</code> and loops like <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>loop</code>.</p>

        <pre><code>// control_flow.rs
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("The number is even");
    } else {
        println!("The number is odd");
    }

    for i in 0..5 {
        println!("i = {}", i);
    }

    let mut counter = 0;
    while counter < 5 {
        println!("Counter = {}", counter);
        counter += 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>

        <h3>Ownership and Borrowing</h3>
        <p>Ownership is one of the key concepts in Rust, ensuring memory safety without a garbage collector. Here's a simple example of ownership and borrowing:</p>

        <pre><code>// ownership.rs
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("Hello");
    let s2 = &s1; // Borrowing s1

    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
    // Ownership of s1 is not moved; itâ€™s borrowed by s2.
}
</code></pre>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Rust offers a unique combination of performance, safety, and concurrency, making it a powerful language for system-level programming. These examples cover the basics of Rust syntax and introduce key concepts such as ownership, mutability, and control flow.</p>
        
        <p>As you progress, you'll dive deeper into more advanced features such as pattern matching, error handling, traits, and concurrency.</p>
