To ensure that Ubuntu maintains network connectivity even when the system is locked or goes idle, you can adjust some settings to prevent the network from disconnecting during idle/lock state without completely disabling sleep. Here's how you can do it:

Option 1: Disable Wi-Fi Power Management
Ubuntu may turn off the Wi-Fi to save power during idle or when the system is locked. You can disable this feature.

Steps:
Check Power Management Status: Open a terminal and check the current power management setting:

bash
Copy code
iwconfig
Look for your Wi-Fi interface (e.g., wlan0) and see if Power Management is listed as "On."

Disable Power Management: To turn off Wi-Fi power management, create a configuration file to apply this setting on boot.

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
Edit/Add the Following Line:

bash
Copy code
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 2
Save the file and exit (Ctrl + O to save, Ctrl + X to exit).

Restart NetworkManager:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
This should ensure that Wi-Fi remains connected even when the system is idle or locked.

Option 2: Modify Systemd Sleep Settings to Keep Network Active
To prevent the system from disabling networking during idle states, you can modify some power management configurations using systemd.

Steps:
Open the Systemd Sleep Configuration: Edit the sleep configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
Modify the Following Parameters:

Ensure that the following parameters are uncommented and set to "ignore":
bash
Copy code
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore
IdleAction=ignore
Restart systemd-logind: After saving the changes, restart the logind service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
This should help to maintain network connections when the system is locked or goes idle.
