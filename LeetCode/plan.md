Basic Concepts:

What is dynamic programming?
Difference between memoization (top-down) and tabulation (bottom-up).
Recognizing DP problems (overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure).

Classic DP Problems:
    Fibonacci sequence (Oct 24th)
    Coin change problem (Oct 24th)
    Longest common subsequence (LCS)
    0/1 Knapsack problem
    Climbing stairs
    Longest increasing subsequence (LIS)

Advanced DP:
    DP with bitmasks (e.g., traveling salesman problem)
    DP on trees and graphs
    DP with two-dimensional grids (e.g., matrix paths)
    Practice on Platforms:

Solve problems from Leetcode, Hackerrank, or Codeforces under the "dynamic programming" tag.
Focus on problems with increasing difficulty.
